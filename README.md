# Agent Small Games

This repository is a collection of small games created using **GitHub Copilot** as the primary development tool. The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of Copilot in generating functional and creative game implementations with minimal manual intervention.

## Project Philosophy

The development process for these games follows a unique approach:

1. **Copilot-Driven Development**: Most of the code is generated by GitHub Copilot, with the developer acting as a guide to steer the AI in the right direction.
2. **Minimal Manual Edits**: The developer makes small adjustments to refine the code, fix issues, or add minor features that Copilot might miss.
3. **Focus on Simplicity**: Each game is designed to be simple, focusing on core gameplay mechanics rather than complex features.

## Current Games

- **Tetris**: A classic Tetris implementation with modern features including ghost pieces, piece holding, next piece preview, particle effects, and scoring system. [Learn more](tetris/README.md)
- **Connect Four**: A two-player Connect Four game implemented in C++ using the SFML library for graphics. [Learn more](connect4/README.md)
- **Tic Tac Toe**: A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. [Learn more](tic_tac_toe/README.md)

## Tech Stack

All games are built using:
- **C++** as the primary programming language
- **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics rendering
- **Make** for build automation

## How to Play

### Building the Games
To build all games:
```bash
make
```

To build a specific game:
```bash
make tetris    # Builds just the Tetris game
make connect4  # Builds just Connect Four
make tic_tac_toe  # Builds just Tic Tac Toe
```

### Running the Games
After building, you can find the executables in the `bin/` directory:
```bash
./bin/tetris
./bin/connect4
./bin/tic_tac_toe
```

## How It Works

1. The developer provides prompts and context to Copilot within the IDE.
2. Copilot generates code based on the prompts and existing project structure.
3. The developer reviews the generated code, makes small edits if necessary, and integrates it into the project.

## Future Plans

Planned additions and improvements include:
- More games to expand the collection
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Sound effects and background music
- High score tracking
- Additional game modes for existing games

## Why This Approach?

This project aims to:

- Showcase the potential of AI-assisted development.
- Highlight the collaborative nature of working with tools like GitHub Copilot.
- Create a fun and educational collection of games.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new game or improve an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request. However, please adhere to the project's philosophy of **Copilot-driven development**.
